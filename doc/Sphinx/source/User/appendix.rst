Metadata References
====================

DDI 2.5
--------

The Dataverse metadata is compliant with the `DDI schema
version 2.5 <http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/>`__. The Metadata fields in the Citation and Social Science blocks
associated with each Dataset contain most of the fields
in the study description section of the DDI. That way the Dataverse
metadata can be mapped easily to a DDI, and be exported into XML
format for preservation and interoperability.

DataCite Schema 3.0
--------------------

Dataverse metadata is compliant with the `DataCite Metadata Schema v.3.0 <http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-3/index.html>`__ (DC) requirements. That way the Dataverse
metadata can be mapped easily to a DataCite, and be exported into XML
format for preservation and interoperability.

DCMI Terms
-----------

Dataverse metadata is compliant with `Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Terms <http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/>`__ (DCMI Terms) requirements. That way the Dataverse
metadata can be mapped easily to DCMI Terms, and be exported into XML
format for preservation and interoperability.


FGDC/CSDGM (imports)
---------------------

For imports only, Dataverse data is compliant with the `Content Standard
for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM), Vers. 2 (FGDC-STD-001-1998) <http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata>`__ (FGDC).
