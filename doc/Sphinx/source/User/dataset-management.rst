Dataset & File Management
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Add Dataset
====================

#. Navigate to the dataverse in which you want to add a Dataset (or in the "root" dataverse). 
#. Click on the "Add Data" button and select "Add Dataset" in the dropdown menu.
#. To quickly get started, enter at minimum all the required fields with an asterisk (e.g., the Dataset Title, Author, Description)
#. Scroll down to "Files" tab and click on "Select Files to Add" to add all the relevant files to your Dataset. Tip: You can drag and drop your files from your desktop, directly into the upload widget. Your file will appear below the "Select Files to Add" button where you can add a description of the file.
#. Click the "Create Dataset" button when you are done. Your unpublished Dataset is now created. 

Note: You can add additional metadata once you have completed the initial Dataset creation by going to Edit Dataset. 


Edit Dataset
==================

Go to your Dataset page and click on the "Edit Dataset" button. There you will have two options where you can either edit:

- Filed (Upload or Edit Data)
- Metadata: now able to add/edit metadata including additional metadata than was not previously available during Dataset Creation.


Publish Dataset
====================

When you publish a Dataset, you make it available to the public. Users can
browse it or search for it. Once your Dataset is ready to go public, go to your Dataset page, 
click on the "Unpublished" button on the right hand side of the page which should indicate: 
"This Dataset is unpublished. To publish it click 'Publish Dataset' link."

Important Note: Once a Dataset is published it cannot be unpublished.
