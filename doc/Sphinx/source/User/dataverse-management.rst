Dataverse Administration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A dataverse is a container for Datasets and is the home for an individual
scholar's, project's, journal's or organization's data.

Once a user creates a dataverse they, by default, become the
administrator of that dataverse. The dataverse administrator has access
to manage the settings described in this guide.

[Should Dataverse Permissions be in this portion of the user guide or in their own sections? Currently in a separate section.}

Create a Dataverse (within the "root" Dataverse)
===================================================

Creating a dataverse is easy but first you must be a registered user (see Create Account).
Depending on site policy, there may be a "Create a Dataverse" link on
the "root" Dataverse home page [is this the case with the new Dataverse?]. 

#. Once you are logged in click on the "Add Data" button and in the dropdown menu select "Create Dataverse".
#. Once on the "New Dataverse" page fill in the following fields:
    * Enter the name of your Dataverse.
    * **Host Dataverse**: select which dataverse you would like this new dataverse to belong to. By default it will be a child dataverse of the parent you clicked from.
    * **Dataverse Alias**: This is an abbreviation, usually lower-case, that becomes part of the URL for the new dataverse. Special characters (~,\`, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, and \*) and spaces are not allowed. **Note**: if you change the Dataverse Alias field, the URL for your Dataverse changes (http//.../dv/'alias'), which affects links to this page.
    * **Contact E-mail**: This is the email address you will receive notifications for this particular Dataverse... [wouldn't it be your account email address by default?]
    * **Affiliation**: Add any Affiliation that can be associated to this particular dataverse (e.g., project name, institute name, department name, journal name, etc).
    * **Description**: Provide a description of this dataverse (max. 1000 characters). This will display on the home page of your dataverse and in the...
3. Click "Create Dataverse" button and you're done! An email will be sent to you with more information, including the URL to access your new dataverse.

\*Required information can vary depending on site policy and are configurable in the Super User Options [add link]. Required fields are noted with a [?].
