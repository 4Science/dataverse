Finding and Using Data
++++++++++++++++++

Without logging in to Dataverse, users can browse
Dataverse, search for dataverses, datasets, and files, view dataset descriptions and files for
public datasets, and subset, analyze and visualize data for public data
files. To view a restricted dataverse, dataset, or file, a user will need to be given permission from that dataverse's adminstrator to access it. 

A user can search the dataverses, datasets, and files within a particular dataverse by using the search bar found on a dataverse page. For example, if you are on the Murray Research Archive Dataverse page, you can search that specific dataverse's contents by using the search bar and/or facets displayed on the page.

- Autocomplete for names of dataverses and file names
- Exact phrase search when a search term/query has quotes around it

Search results features: 

- Facets: to the left of the search results, there are several facets a user can click on to narrow the number of results displayed. 
    - Choosing a facet: to choose a facet, click on the facet to choose it
