How the Guides Are Organized
=========================

The user guides are reference documents that explain how to use
the DVN functionality: Installers Guide, Developers Guide, and Users
Guide. The Users Guide is further divided into primary activities: using
data, creating studies, administering dataverses or the network. Details
on all of the above tasks can be found in the Users Guide. The
Installers Guide is for people or organizations who want to host their
own Dataverse Network. The Developers Guide contains instructions for
people who want to contribute to the Open Source Dataverse Network
project or who want to modify the code to suit their own needs
