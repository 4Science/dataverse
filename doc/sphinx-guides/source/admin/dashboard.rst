Dashboard
=========

Dataverse offers a dashboard of administrative tools for superusers only. If you are a logged-in superuser, you will see a "Dashboard" link in the navbar, next to your name. You can verify that you are a superuser by checking your name in the navbar. If it's red, you have the right permissions to use the Dashboard.
