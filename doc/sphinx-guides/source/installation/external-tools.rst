Configuring External Tools
==========================

The Dataverse Team encourages the wider community to contribute to our software. Sometimes these contributions take the form of external tools that can be integrated into Dataverse as modular features. This page will discuss how to configure external tools in general, and provide specific instructions for some of these tools in particular. For more information or technical support on each tool, it's recommended that you reach out to their creators.
