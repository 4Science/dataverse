Geoconnect
==========

Geoconnect works as a middle layer, allowing geospatial data files in Dataverse to be visualized with Harvard WorldMap. To setup a Geoconnect development environment, you can follow the steps outlined in the `set up file <https://github.com/IQSS/geoconnect/blob/master/heroku_setup.md>`_.

The set up file describes setting up Geoconnect on a Heroku server using the Django settings in ``geoconnect.settings.heroku``. You will need a Heroku account and a few other prerequisites.
