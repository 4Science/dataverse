WorldMap: Geospatial Data Exploration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

WorldMap
===========
`WorldMap <http://worldmap.harvard.edu/>`_ is developed by the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard and is an open source software that helps researchers visualize and explore their data in maps. The WorldMap and Dataverse collaboration allows researchers to be able to upload shapefiles to Dataverse for long term storage and receive a persistent identifer (through DOI) as well as be able to easily move into WorldMap to interact with the data.

Uploading Shapefiles to Dataverse
=====================================
To get started, you will need to create a dataset in Dataverse. For more detailed instructions on creating a dataset, read the `Dataset + File Management <http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataset-management.html>`_ portion of this user guide.

Dataverse recognizes ZIP files that contain the components of a shapefile and will ingest them as a ZIP but will extract out any pdfs.

Once you have uploaded your ZIP files comprising a shapefile, a Map Data button will appear next to the file in the dataset.

Click on the Map Data button to be brought to GeoConnect, the portal between Dataverse and WorldMap that will process your shapefile and send it to WorldMap.
