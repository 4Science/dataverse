# We assume you've done everything in scripts/search/tests/dataset-versioning03
# There should now be two Solr documents for the same dataset with different titles:
# 
# Version 1.0 has the published title and a single published file
# Title: Rings of Trees and Other Observations
# files: 18:trees.png
#
# The version that is post 1.0 has a different title
# Title: Rings of Conifers and Other Observations
# files: 18:trees.png
#
# Now let's add a second file to the unpublished version of the study:
#
# http://localhost:8080/dataset.xhtml?id=17
#
# The new file should be named trees2.png and have a description of
# "Another tree image."
#
# anon should be able to see the published 1.0 version but not the new draft and not the new file
# (no change from dataset-versioning02anon)
