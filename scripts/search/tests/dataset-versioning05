# We assume you've done everything in scripts/search/tests/dataset-versioning04
# There should now be two Solr documents for datasets with different titles.
# 
# Version 1.0 has a single file
# Title: Rings of Trees and Other Observations
# files: 18:trees.png
#
# The version that is post 1.0 but unpublished has two files
# Title: Rings of Conifers and Other Observations
# files: 18:trees.png, 19:trees2.png
#
# Now let's change the description of the published file (18:trees.png) from
# "Trees are lovely."
# to
# "The first picture of trees I uploaded."
#
# (logging for indexing is unchanged from output in dataset-versioning04)
#
# anon should be able to see the published 1.0 version but not the new draft and not the new file
# and not the change in description
# (no change from dataset-versioning02anon)
