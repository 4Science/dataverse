# We assume you've done everything in scripts/search/tests/dataset-versioning05
# 
# Now we publish the version that is post 1.0 but unpublished and has
# two files (the description was changed on trees.png)
# Title: Rings of Conifers and Other Observations
# files: 18:trees.png, 19:trees2.png

# the expected index logging should be something like this:

#deleteDraftDatasetVersionResult: Attempted to delete draft dataset_17_draft from Solr index. updateRep
#onse was: {responseHeader={status=0,QTime=0}}, deleteDraftFilesResults: Attempted to delete draft datafile_19_draft from Solr index. updateReponse
# was: {responseHeader={status=0,QTime=0}}Attempted to delete draft datafile_18_draft from Solr index. updateReponse was: {responseHeader={status=0
# ,QTime=0}}, indexReleasedVersionResult:indexed dataset 17 as dataset_17
# indexFilesResults for dataset_17, filesIndexed: [datafile_19, datafile_18], 
# rationale:
# version found with database id 2
# - title: Rings of Conifers and Other Observations
# - semanticVersion-STATE: 2.0-RELEASED
# - isWorkingCopy: false
# - isReleased: true
# - files: 2 [19:trees2.png, 18:trees.png]
# version found with database id 1
# - title: Rings of Trees and Other Observations
# - semanticVersion-STATE: 1.0-RELEASED
# - isWorkingCopy: false
# - isReleased: true
# - files: 1 [18:trees.png]
# The latest version is not a working copy (latestVersionState: RELEASED) and will be indexed as dataset_17 (visible by anonymous) and we will be de
# leting dataset_17_draft and its files (if any, num:2): [datafile_19_draft, datafile_18_draft]
#
# anon should be able to see the published 2.0 version
