Swift installation:

Before reading this, please make sure you installed all the prerequisites as described on http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/index.html

Glassfish config
•	Create file .../glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/swift.properties 
•	The file is formatted as follows with a few exceptions:

		swift.default.endpoint=endpoint1
		swift.auth_url.endpoint1=your-auth-url 
		swift.tenant.endpoint1=your-tenant-name
		swift.username.endpoint1=your-username
		swift.password.endpoint1=your-password
		swift.auth_type.endpoint1=your-authentication-type ('basic' or 'keystone', we use 'keystone' in our case)
		swift.swift_endpoint.endpoint1=your-swift-endpoint (for MOC, it is 'http://rdgw.kaizen.massopencloud.org/swift/v1')

•	If your authentication method is basic, not keystone, you can remove the swift.tenant.endpoint1 line, but it isn’t necessary.
•	Before you run the installer, you need to go into your dataverse/scripts/installer/glassfish-setup.sh and update two lines:
		./asadmin $ASADMIN_OPTS create-jvm-options "\-Ddataverse.files.storage-driver-id=swift"
		./asadmin $ASADMIN_OPTS create-jvm-options "\-Ddataverse.files.swift-endpoint-start= ‘your-endpoint-start’ "

•	Where your-endpoint-start is the first unique bit of your swift endpoint, for example 'http://rdgw'
•	And then run the installer and you should be able to see containers at your swift endpoint.
